 The Padi Lucas Junction is the intersection of NH 205 (Madras-Tiruvallur High Road) and Inner Ring Road in the city of Chennai and is one of the most important junctions in the city. It is located in Anna Nagar north of Koyambedu Junction. An elevated rotary has been constructed at this junction as part of the NHDP by NHAI to ease the traffic congestion. It was built at a cost of â‚¹ 1,300 million and was opened for traffic on 20 February 2009.  The flyover was built to ease the traffic flow between Ambattur, Villivakkam, Red Hills, and Kolathur and the Kolkata Highway. The flyover is the main junction connecting Korattur, Koyambedu, Villivakkam, Thirumangalam areas in the city.
